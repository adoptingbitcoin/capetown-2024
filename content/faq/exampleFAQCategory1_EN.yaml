  - question: 'Visa'
    answer: 'Visa requirements vary depending on your nationality. We recommend checking with the South African embassy or consulate in your country for the most up-to-date information. In some cases, an unabridged birth certificate may be required for travellers with children. Please ensure you have all necessary travel documents before planning your trip.
