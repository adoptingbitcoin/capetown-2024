    answer: 'If you are an international attendee, please check the official Salvadoran immigration website to determine if you need a visa to attend the conference. Currently, there are three types of visas available: visa exemption, visa on arrival, and consular visa. If you require a consular visa, we can provide an official invitation letter from the Minister of Tourism to facilitate your visa application process. To obtain the letter, you will need to provide us with:
<br>- A confirmed itinerary from your country to El Salvador, which must not exceed 30 days. 
<br>- A scanned copy of your passport. 
<br>- Your Adopting Bitcoin ticket code. <br>
Please note that we can only provide an invitation letter and visa support for El Salvador and not for any other country.
