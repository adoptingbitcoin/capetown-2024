I fell down the Bitcoin rabbit role many years ago and couldn't stop studying it. As a visual learner, I took countless notes and made them available for free because everyone deserves an equal opportunity to learn. I'm on a mission to spark curiosity in one student at a time and enable Bitcoin as a form of payment through education and not its price. With a background in engineering, I've spent the past decade in customer-facing roles in SaaS and fintech.
