Oliver is a Senior Lightning Infrastructure Engineer ad Lightning Labs. Previously worked as a software engineer for a Swiss bank before joining a smaller software company in Bern focusing on Open Source. During that time he discovered Bitcoin and Lightning and started contributing to LND and related projects. Falling deeper down the rabbit hole, he realized that there really was no alternative to working on L2 full-time. His B.Sc. with focus on the HTTP/2 protocol and his experience as full-stack developer help him build infrastructure for Lightning Loop and other backend services of the Lightning Network.
