Marthinus Grobler is a South African architect with a particular interest in economics and dedicated to advancing liberty. Throughout his career, he has worked on and investigated many disciplines of the design scale and is mostly concerned with the networks of the city and its manifestations in urban form and culture. Together with various groups, he is developing mechanisms allowing neighbourhoods and cities to evolve as a result of voluntary human actions. This is based on studies into the processes of emergent order found in natureâ€™s distributed systems and the principles of Austrian Economics. He is also campaigning for multiculturalism through political decentralization. He is currently the chief architect for Tipolis, a company establishing free private cities across the world.
