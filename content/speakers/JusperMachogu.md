An agricultural engineer, small scale farmer, climate change skeptic and a Fossil Fuels for Africa advocate. Why Africa Needs Fossil Fuels. While the rest of the world pursues renewable energy, I advocate for fossil fuels in my continent because modern civilization is tied to the use of coal, oil, and natural gas, of which Africa has an abundance. The level of energy consumption directly correlates with human flourishing, especially for developing economies. In a continent that is agriculture-based, we can increase production, ultimately ending hunger and poverty, and stopping toil by providing access to cheap, reliable energy from Fossil Fuels.
