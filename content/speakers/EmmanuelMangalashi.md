Bitcoin Victoria Falls was inspired by The Hope House's Bitcoin Beach project in El Zonte, El Salvador. The Free Haven Community Initiative in Livingstone, Zambia is very similar in its philanthropic nature and community initiatives. These community and educational ties inspired a Bitcoin Circular Economy in Zambia with a focus on education and merchant adoption. This project will be led by two teachers who are a part of Bitcoin for Fairness Zambia, Mabvuto and Humphrey from Lusaka, Zambia. They will travel to Livingstone for 2 days each week to teach the My First Bitcoin curriculum, onboard merchants, and host Bitcoin meetups. We are ready for launch!
