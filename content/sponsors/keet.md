Keet is a peer-to-peer chat application that uses end-to-end encryption to protect user data. It allows users to make video and text calls, share files, and even accept payments without the need for a server. Keet is designed to be private, secure, and efficient. But Keet is just the beginning, on February 14th, weâ€™ll release Pear Runtime, making it easy for any web developer to build their own unstoppable P2P apps like Keet.
